        "Alphafold2's predition is quite impressive. But all of the predition was based on 1st primary structureof the peptide, which ignores the individual environment of the protien, such as (pH, temperature, ion strength, or even the presence of other molecules like ligand and so forth). Fortunately, the NMR assignment of the chemical shift from each atom of protein molecule is the closest the in vivo of the protein state. In addition, NMR spectrum contains tons of infomation of each atom of molecules that had never been fully digged in. Most of the info has been ignored, due to the complicated combination of each minor quantum effect (resultantly largely effect).\n",
